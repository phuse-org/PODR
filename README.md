# PHUSE Open Data Repository ("PODR")
PODR is powered by [NIHPO’s Platform](http://nihpo.com)

# Description

One challenge when using Open Data is that the raw data distributed by academic and government sources comes in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, XML). And sometimes a single dataset has used different file layouts over the years.

A second challenge with using Open Data is the need for users to integrate all those disparate datasets from multiple sources into an easy-to-search system.

PODR integrates health-related Open Data across agencies, within departments of each relevant agency, and across countries. PODR gives users a single interface to search across all available datasets.

NIHPO and PHUSE intend PODR to:
* Increase PHUSE member engagement with PHUSE’s Working Groups and events.
* Eliminate user’s time-consuming “Data Prep” process of loading and massaging raw data. “From Zero to Analysis” in under five minutes.
* Accelerate discovery of solutions to data-centric challenges posed by PHUSE sponsors, members.
* Make it easier for PHUSE members to learn new tools and technologies (Jupyter, Python, R).
* Give each PHUSE member the opportunity to quickly launch new projects and collaborative research projects with other members.
* Make data analytics accessible to all levels of users, from Excel users to power users. 

And where PHUSE members will not need any IT involvement to use PODR.


# Background

This is the presentation delivered during the [launch webinar](/NIHPO_PHUSE_Launch_04.pdf)  on 08 May 2020.

And this presentation outlines the concept of PHUSE as a "Glass Building" where members and other stakeholders come together in a spirit of total transparency.
